# Running instructions

1. Install http-server for npm if it is not already installed:  npm install http-server -g
2. In the base project directory run: http-server


By default it will select port 8080 and will be accesible from  http://localhost:8080
index.html is hardcoded to look for the tiles in localhost:8080. If you point to a different
host or port, it will need to be updated accordingly.
